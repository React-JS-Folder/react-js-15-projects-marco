The React JS tutorial has 2 parts. 
1. - React JS Basics ----------------- done!
2. - React JS Advanced

## To follow the React JS Advanced I needed to download the tutorial folder from Github. 
  1. - I deleted everything from my "react-js-15-projects" I only kept .git file  
  2. - I passed the Advanced Folder content in it.
  3. - Install project dependencies // npm install    -Github only store dependencies names
