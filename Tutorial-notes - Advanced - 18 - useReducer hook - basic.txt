useReducer is useful when you want to group multiple useState variables

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { });     //state, dispatch are just names, but there are used in the web comunity

1. state // all the useState values 
2. dispatch // actions (functions)
3. reducer  // function 
4. object with initial values for each useState variable 

-------------------------

ORDER OF THE STEPS 
1. Import { useReducer } from 'react'     //Import useReducer hook 

2. Create the function reducer(state, action)          //this function is a switch statement with multiple functions inside for each case

3. Initialize the useReducer state        //const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { });  

4. Assign the function to a button to execute onClick

5. Place the code inside the html
