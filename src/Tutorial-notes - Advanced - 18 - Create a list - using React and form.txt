How to add elements to a list dinamically (using a form)

the elements of the list is a map and it will be printed on click everytime 
the map is an array of objects created with useState([])
and every time you send the form you will update the list (array of objects)

You send the form data as list item onSubmit

-------------------------------------------------
React needs to index elements of the map, each element needs a unique key
if the elements of the map don't have id you can get new Date() as key value
example:
id: new Date().getTime().toString();

To create a new object with useState values 
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
const [people, setPeople] = useState([]);

const person = {id: new Date().getTime().toString(), firstName, email}

setPeople( () => {
  [...people, person];    // now the person object is inside the people array
})
