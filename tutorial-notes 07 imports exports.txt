Imports Exports are used in React, but they are just ES6 Modules 

To import content of a JS file you have to actually "import the file", but you also have to export the content of the file 

# JS files #
export const books = "string to export";     //add "export" to the variable o function you want to export
import {books} from './books'                //import variable o function from js file 

# CSS files #
import './css/books.css'                     // don't use "export", but import needs to add path and extension'

# React Components #
import Component1 from './components/Component1'   // add "export"   //components have "1 default" export


example:

index.js ###################################
import React from 'react'           //imported files from react need not the path
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'    //imported files from react need not the path


import './index.css'              css files need the path and the extension to import 
import {books} from './books'     js files need the path but not the extension to import
