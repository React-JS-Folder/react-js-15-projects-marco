How to upload a React JS App/Website

# 1. npm run build       // to make a live React app/website  //from development to production environment 
   It will create a folder in src called "build" and now it is ready to be deployed

# 2. Find a Hosting Provider (for the course -- www.netlify.com   //free hosting)
   create a free account and drag and drop the built project to import

# 3. when you drag and drop it will give you a website name .netlify.app
the website default name is in the page Getting Started. (but you have already a website with default name)


the website/app is successfully running online!!
